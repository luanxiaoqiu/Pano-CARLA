# Pano-CARLA
This is a panoramic dataset based on CARLA. A random panning camera is used to generate a panoramic ERP sequence. Each sequence is based on the panoramic view constructed by CARLA Street View, and the data set consists of 1000 frames of panoramas (1024Ã—2048) and metadata of virtual camera poses.
